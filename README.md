Slide-Carousel-Simple
=====================

Just add JPEGs to an "Images" folder just outside of the slideCarouselSimple.php file. The carousel requires PHP5 or higher to be loaded on its hosting server. I wrote this in Javascript, PHP, HTML5, and CSS and its fully compatible with mobile and desktop platforms... Enjoy!
